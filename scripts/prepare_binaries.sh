# Most distros ship 32-bit toolchains with SJLJ unwinding, but for 32-bit Rust
# can only cross-compile targeting DWARF. All 64-bit toolchains use SEH, where
# there is no problem. One of two workarounds is required:

# Disable unwinding with with "-C panic=abort" instead. Without `catch_unwind`
# use in the Rust code or luck in the DreamDaemon runtime, panics already bring
# down the host process anyways.

# Use wine to run rust-mingw component distributed by Rust for pc-windows-gnu:
# wget https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-mingw-nightly-i686-pc-windows-gnu.tar.gz
# tar xf rust-mingw-nightly-i686-pc-windows-gnu.tar.gz
# ./rust-mingw-nightly-i686-pc-windows-gnu/install.sh --prefix=$(rustc --print sysroot)

# Luckily we are taking the third workaround, which is using the cross projects i686
# windows toolchain docker which comes with an updated version of mingw that supports
# the DWARF based unwinding, freeing us from such earthly concerns
